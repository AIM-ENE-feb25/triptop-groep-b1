# ADR 0003: State Management

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The TripTop application requires robust state management to handle complex user interactions, booking processes, and real-time updates across both web and mobile platforms. We need a solution that can efficiently manage application state, handle side effects, and maintain consistency across different components.

## Decision
We will implement Redux as our state management solution for both the web and mobile applications. Redux provides a predictable state container that will help us manage the application's state in a centralized store. This includes managing authentication state, booking information, trip planning data, and payment processing states.

The decision to use Redux is based on several key factors. Redux offers centralized state management that allows us to maintain a single source of truth for our application state. The predictable state updates through reducers ensure that state changes are handled consistently and are easy to debug. The strong ecosystem and community support means we have access to a wealth of resources, middleware, and tools. Redux's excellent integration with React and React Native makes it a natural choice for our tech stack, while the built-in developer tools provide powerful debugging capabilities.

## Consequences
Using Redux will provide several significant benefits to our application. The predictable state updates and debugging capabilities will make it easier to track and fix issues in our application. The centralized state management across components will help maintain consistency and reduce the complexity of state synchronization. This approach will lead to better code organization and maintainability, making it easier for our team to work on the codebase. The enhanced developer experience with Redux DevTools will further improve our development workflow.

However, implementing Redux also introduces certain challenges. The additional boilerplate code required for actions and reducers can make simple state changes more complex than necessary. New developers will need to learn Redux's concepts and patterns, which can slow down initial development. There's also the risk of over-engineering for simple state changes, and we'll need to carefully plan our state structure to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Considered Options

| Option                     | Redux | Context API | MobX |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| **Scalability**            | ++    | +           | +    |
| **Learning Curve**         | -     | ++          | -    |
| **Developer Experience**   | +     | +           | +    |
| **Community Support**      | ++    | +           | +    |
| **Integration**            | ++    | +           | +    |

Legend:
- ++ : Excellent fit / Strong advantage
- + : Good fit / Advantage
- 0 : Neutral / Average
- - : Poor fit / Disadvantage
- -- : Very poor fit / Strong disadvantage

## Alternatives Considered
We carefully evaluated several alternatives before choosing Redux. The React Context API was considered for its simplicity and built-in nature, but it lacks the robust state management features needed for our complex application. MobX was another option that provides good state management capabilities, but it has a steeper learning curve and less community support compared to Redux.

## Conclusion
Redux is the optimal choice for our state management needs, providing the right balance of features, community support, and integration capabilities for both our web and mobile applications. While it introduces some complexity, the benefits of predictable state management, strong ecosystem support, and excellent developer tools outweigh the initial learning curve and additional boilerplate code.
