# ADR 0004: Database Type

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The TripTop application requires a flexible and scalable database solution that can handle various types of data, including user profiles, trip information, bookings, and authentication details. The data structure may evolve over time as we add new features and requirements. We need a database that can efficiently handle both structured and semi-structured data while maintaining good performance and scalability.

## Decision
We will implement MongoDB as our primary database solution for both the trip and user databases. MongoDB's document-based architecture aligns perfectly with our needs, allowing us to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This structure is particularly well-suited for our trip planning and booking system, where data structures may vary and evolve over time.

The decision to use MongoDB is based on several key factors. MongoDB's schema-less design provides the flexibility we need to adapt our data models as the application evolves. The document-based structure naturally represents our trip and user data, making it easier to model complex relationships. MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities through sharding will allow us to scale our application as our user base grows. The rich query language and aggregation framework will enable us to perform complex queries and data analysis efficiently.

## Consequences
Using MongoDB will provide several significant benefits to our application. The flexible schema design will make it easier to iterate on our data models without requiring complex migrations. The document-based structure will simplify the representation of nested data, which is common in travel and booking information. MongoDB's built-in support for geospatial queries will be valuable for location-based features in our trip planning system. The ability to scale horizontally will ensure our application can handle growing data volumes and user loads.

However, implementing MongoDB also introduces certain challenges. The lack of strict schema validation requires careful application-level validation to ensure data integrity. The eventual consistency model may require additional consideration for certain use cases where strong consistency is crucial. We'll need to carefully design our indexes to optimize query performance, and the memory usage can be higher compared to traditional relational databases.

## Considered Options

- ++ : Excellent fit / Strong advantage
- + : Good fit / Advantage
- 0 : Neutral / Average
- - : Poor fit / Disadvantage
- -- : Very poor fit / Strong disadvantage

## Alternatives Considered
We carefully evaluated several alternatives before choosing MongoDB. PostgreSQL was considered for its strong ACID compliance and robust relational features, but its rigid schema structure would make it more difficult to adapt to our evolving data requirements. MySQL was another option that offers good performance and reliability, but it lacks the flexibility and scalability features we need for our growing application. CouchDB was evaluated for its excellent offline support and eventual consistency model, but its limited query capabilities and smaller community size made it less suitable for our needs, despite its strong document-based architecture.

## Conclusion
MongoDB is the optimal choice for our database needs, providing the right balance of flexibility, scalability, and performance for both our trip and user databases. While it requires careful consideration of data consistency and schema design, the benefits of flexible data modeling, horizontal scaling, and rich query capabilities outweigh the challenges. This choice will allow us to build a robust and scalable application that can adapt to changing requirements and growing user needs.
