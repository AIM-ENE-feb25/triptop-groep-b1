# 001: Integration with Booking.com API for Accommodation Search

Date: 2024-03-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Triptop application needs to provide accommodation search functionality to allow users to find and book hotels as part of their trip planning. Instead of building and maintaining our own accommodation database, we need to integrate with an existing service that provides comprehensive and up-to-date accommodation data.

Some key requirements are access to a large database of accommodations worldwide, the ability to search by location, dates, and other filters, and detailed information about each accommodation, including photos, prices, and reviews. Additionally, support for different languages and currencies is needed.

## Considered Options

| Force | Booking.com API | Expedia API | Hotels.com API | Airbnb API |

| **Data Completeness** | ++ | + | + | 0 |
| **Global Coverage** | ++ | + | + | 0 |
| **Development Effort** | + | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Integration Complexity** | + | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Maintenance Burden** | + | + | + | + |
| **Update Frequency** | ++ | + | + | + |
| **API Stability** | + | 0 | 0 | - |

- ++ : Excellent fit / Strong advantage
- + : Good fit / Advantage
- 0 : Neutral / Average
- - : Poor fit / Disadvantage
- -- : Very poor fit / Strong disadvantage

## Decision

We will integrate with the Booking.com API via RapidAPI to provide accommodation search functionality. The integration will consist of:

1. A client-side wrapper (`BookingApiClient`) that handles API requests and response mapping
2. Extension of our domain model to support the Booking.com API requirements
3. Mapping between our domain model and the Booking.com API data structures

## Consequences

### Positive
Access to a comprehensive, up-to-date database of accommodations worldwide is one benefit. The data is professionally managed with regular updates. There is also reduced development and maintenance effort compared to maintaining our own accommodation database. Additionally, the application benefits from a standardized interface for accommodation search across different parts of the system.

### Negative
However, there is a dependency on an external service, which could change or become unavailable. Potential costs associated with API usage may arise as the application scales. The domain model would also need to be adapted to fit the API requirements. Finally, there is limited control over the data and features available.
