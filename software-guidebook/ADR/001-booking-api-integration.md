# 001: Integration with Booking.com API for Accommodation Search

Date: 2024-03-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Triptop application needs to provide accommodation search functionality to allow users to find and book hotels as part of their trip planning. Instead of building and maintaining our own accommodation database, we need to integrate with an existing service that provides comprehensive and up-to-date accommodation data.

Key requirements:
- Access to a large database of accommodations worldwide
- Ability to search by location, dates, and other filters
- Detailed information about each accommodation, including photos, prices, and reviews
- Support for different languages and currencies

## Considered Options

| Force | Booking.com API | Expedia API | Hotels.com API | Airbnb API |

| **Data Completeness** | ++ | + | + | 0 |
| **Global Coverage** | ++ | + | + | 0 |
| **Development Effort** | + | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Integration Complexity** | + | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Maintenance Burden** | + | + | + | + |
| **Update Frequency** | ++ | + | + | + |
| **API Stability** | + | 0 | 0 | - |
| **Variety of Accommodations** | + | + | 0 | ++ |

- + : Good fit / Advantage
- 0 : Neutral / Average
- - : Poor fit / Disadvantage
- -- : Very poor fit / Strong disadvantage

## Decision

We will integrate with the Booking.com API via RapidAPI to provide accommodation search functionality. The integration will consist of:

1. A client-side wrapper (`BookingApiClient`) that handles API requests and response mapping
2. Extension of our domain model to support the Booking.com API requirements
3. Mapping between our domain model and the Booking.com API data structures

## Consequences

### Positive

- Access to a comprehensive, up-to-date database of accommodations worldwide
- Professionally managed data with regular updates
- Reduced development and maintenance effort compared to maintaining our own accommodation database
- Standardized interface for accommodation search across different parts of the application

### Negative

- Dependency on an external service that could change or become unavailable
- Potential costs associated with API usage as the application scales
- Need to adapt our domain model to fit the API requirements
- Limited control over the data and features available
